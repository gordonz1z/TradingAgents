It seems there was an issue retrieving the fundamental information for the company with the ticker "LI" (Li Auto Inc.). The error suggests that the data is not available or the ticker might not be correctly configured in the system.

To proceed, I can:
1. Verify the ticker symbol (e.g., "LI" for Li Auto Inc.).
2. Try alternative spellings or ticker formats if applicable.
3. Check if the data source has coverage for this specific company.

Would you like me to proceed with any of these steps, or do you have additional details to provide?
